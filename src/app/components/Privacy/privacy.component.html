                    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.

                    (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from
                    California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information

                    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include
                    have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding
                    the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with
                    the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                      should a data breach occur:</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        We will notify you via email within 7 business days

                      <li>

                    </ul>

                    We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
                    rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires
                    not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have
                    recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
